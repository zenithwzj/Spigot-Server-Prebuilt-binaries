# Spigot-Server-Prebuilt-binaries 
### 预构建 Spigot Minecraft服务端 1.8+
This is the spigot server builder, only for versions newer than 1.8. For older versions, please check [Jenkins CI](https://ci.md-5.net/job/Spigot/).  
Notify me in the pr if a new version of spigot released.  

**Caution**: Due to the log4j2 security issue, some of the prebuilt versions **ARE NOT** safe because they are not patched although they are built recently, see [the Official Thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/spigot-security-releases-%E2%80%94-1-8-8%E2%80%931-18.537204/).
